# Complexity-based Dataset Generation

An Evolutionary Scalable Framework for Synthetic Data Generation based in Data Complexity. 

**üá¨üáß English** - [üáßüá∑ Portugu√™s Brasileiro](./README_pt-br.md)

`cbdgen` (**C**omplexity-**b**ased **D**ataset **Gen**eration) is a software, currently in development to become a framework, that implements a many-objective algorithm to generate synthetic datasets from characteristics (complexities).

## Requirements

Due to the actual state of the framework, a few steps are necessary/optional to run the framework. Here we list the requirements to run this project, as well as a few tutorials:

1. [Install R](./docs/setup-r.md)
2. Install Python
3. [Python Environment (Optional)](./docs/setup-python-venv.md)
4. [Setup `cbdgen`](#setting-up)

## Setting up

### Install R packages

It is required `ECoL` package to correctly calculate data complexity, to do so you can use the following command:

```console
./install_packages.r
```

> If you've successfully installed R, this Rscript will work fine, but if you get any error using the R environment, Try [Working with ECoL](./examples/ECoL-in-python.ipynb) notebook to setup `ECoL` package with Python.

### Install Python dependencies

Let's use `pip` to install our packages based on our `requirements.txt`.

```console
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you're ready to Generate Synthetic Data!
